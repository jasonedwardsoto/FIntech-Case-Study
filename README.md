## Overview and Orgin
* Founded April 18, 2013

* Founders are Vladimir Tenev & Baiju Bhatt

* Two students/roommates from Stanford University moved to New York City and sold trading software to hedge funds.

They built today’s industry standard with a commission free trading application that allows the average investor to trade and sell stocks, cryptocurrency, options, American depositary receipt (ADR) and Exchange Traded Fund (ETF).



* According to [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/robinhood) Over 23 rounds of funding equalling $5.6B. Their latest funding was raised on Feb 1, 2021 from a Covertible Note round

* RobinHood’s customer base are beginners who want to invest in fractional shares and cryptocurrencies. Robinhood attracts users with 100% commission free trading, free stocks, and account minimums of $0. The pandemic brought a surge of users to the application, bringing their influx of cash from government stimulus payments.  As of 2020, the user based is reported at 13 million users. Robinhood has contributed to a culture that has “gamified” securities trading into something like a casino. Robinhood makes investing so frictionless and accessible that some people end up trading beyond their knowledge and financial means. 

      

* The unfair advantage RobinHood is doing to its users is selling trade data to quant trading firms like Citdel, 2 Simga Securities, Susquehanna International Group and Virtu Financial. This is not the first time a company has sold its data.  E-trade has earned about $200 million in 2019 selling their user’s trading data.  Their Wall Street clients fed off inexperienced investors who chased volatile momentum stock and invested into risky options trading
